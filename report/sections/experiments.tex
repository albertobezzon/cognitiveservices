		Training a deep learning model that involves intensive compute tasks on large dataset can take days to run on a single CPU or a slow GPU. In our case, since HAM10000 dataset has 10015 images, it is unthinkable to perform the training of a convolutional neural network with a standard laptop. The solution turned to cloud computing. The choice fells on Google Cloud Platform because of the availability of free tier that consists in 300\$ free credits that can be used in any GCP product.

		We have tested our CNN models on a custom instance of Compute Engine. Our VMâ€™s configuration is presented in Table \ref{tab:hw-config}

		Our models have been implemented in keras using tensorflow as a backend. The code is available on our GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/albertobezzon/cognitiveservices}
